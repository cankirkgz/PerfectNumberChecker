<h1>Perfect Number Checker</h1>

<p>This Java program checks whether a given number is a perfect number or not. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors (excluding the number itself).</p>

<h2>What is a Perfect Number?</h2>

<p>A perfect number is a number that satisfies the following condition: the sum of its proper divisors (excluding the number itself) equals the number itself.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Enter a positive integer number.</li>
  <li>The program will determine whether the number is perfect or not.</li>
  <li>If the number is perfect, it will display "The number is a perfect number."</li>
  <li>If the number is not perfect, it will display "The number is not a perfect number."</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Example 1:</strong><br>
  Input: 28<br>
  Output: The number is a perfect number.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Example 2:</strong><br>
  Input: 1<br>
  Output: The number is not a perfect number.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Example 3:</strong><br>
  Input: 496<br>
  Output: The number is a perfect number.
</p>

<h2>How it Works</h2>

<p>The program calculates the sum of the proper divisors of the given number and compares it with the number itself. If they are equal, the number is classified as a perfect number.</p>
